>>> from pyogp.lib.base.credentials import PlainPasswordCredential
>>> from pyogp.lib.base.agentdomain import AgentDomain
>>> from pyogp.lib.base.regiondomain import Region

First we create some credentials:
>>> credentials = PlainPasswordCredential('Firstname', 'Lastname', 'password')

Then we need some agent domain to connect to. This might automatically retrieve some XRDS file to get the actual login endpoint:
>>> agentdomain = AgentDomain('http://agent.domain')

Now we can use both to get an agent object (which transparently handles capabilities etc.):
>>> agent = AgentDomain.login(credentials)

The next step is to use this agent to actually place the avatar somewhere. We therefor need a region:
>>> region = Region('http://region.uri')

Note that we can also first retrieve a RegionDomain object and ask this for possible regions and a map etc.


So let's place the agent in form of an avatar there (or try it at least):
>>> avatar = region.place_avatar(agent)

Now we should establish a presence there:

avatar.establish_presence()

As this is an infinite loop the question is how this could be handled. Maybe in a different thread?
