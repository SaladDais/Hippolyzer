        Yield each of the values returned by function(), in the order they're
        completed rather than the order the coroutines were launched.

        Iteration stops when we've yielded results for each arguments tuple in
        iterable. Unlike wait_all() and process_all(), this function does not
        wait for any previously-submitted execute() or execute_async() calls.

        Results are temporarily buffered in a queue. If you pass qsize=, this
        value is used to limit the max size of the queue: an attempt to buffer
        too many results will suspend the completed CoroutinePool coroutine
        until the requesting coroutine (the caller of generate_results()) has
        retrieved one or more results by calling this generator-iterator's
        next().

        If any coroutine raises an uncaught exception, that exception will
        propagate to the requesting coroutine via the corresponding next() call.

        What I particularly want these tests to illustrate is that using this
        generator function:

        for result in generate_results(function, iterable):
            # ... do something with result ...

        executes coroutines at least as aggressively as the classic eventlet
        idiom:

        events = [pool.execute(function, *args) for args in iterable]
        for event in events:
            result = event.wait()
            # ... do something with result ...

        even without a distinct event object for every arg tuple in iterable,
        and despite the funny flow control from interleaving launches of new
        coroutines with yields of completed coroutines' results.

        (The use case that makes this function preferable to the classic idiom
        above is when the iterable, which may itself be a generator, produces
        millions of items.)
