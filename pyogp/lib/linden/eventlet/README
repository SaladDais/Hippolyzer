Eventlet is a networking library written in Python. It achieves high
scalability by using non-blocking io while at the same time retaining
high programmer usability by using coroutines to make the non-blocking
io operations appear blocking at the source code level.

The wiki at http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Eventlet is likely to be a
more current source of information than this README.  Questions,
patches, and general discussion go to the eventlet mailing list:
https://lists.secondlife.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/eventletdev

== requirements ===

Eventlet runs on Python version 2.3 or greater, with the following dependenceis:
* [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/greenlet
* (if running python versions < 2.4) collections.py from the 2.4 distribution or later

== limitations ==

* Sorely lacking in documentation
* Not enough test coverage -- the goal is 100%, but we are not there yet.
* Eventlet does not currently run on stackless using tasklets, though
it is a goal to do so in the future.
* The SSL client does not properly connect to the SSL server, though
both client and server interoperate with other SSL implementations
(e.g. curl and apache).

== getting started ==

% python
>>> from eventlet import api
>>> help(api)

Also, look at the examples in the examples directory.

== eventlet history ==

eventlet began life as Donovan Preston was talking to Bob Ippolito
about coroutine-based non-blocking networking frameworks in
Python. Most non-blocking frameworks require you to run the "main
loop" in order to perform all network operations, but Donovan wondered
if a library written using a trampolining style could get away with
transparently running the main loop any time i/o was required,
stopping the main loop once no more i/o was scheduled. Bob spent a few
days during PyCon 2005 writing a proof-of-concept. He named it
eventlet, after the coroutine implementation it used,
[[greenlet]]. Donovan began using eventlet as a light-weight network
library for his spare-time project Pavel, and also began writing some
unittests.

When Donovan started at Linden Lab in May of 2006, he added eventlet
as an svn external in the indra/lib/python directory, to be a
dependency of the yet-to-be-named [[backbone]] project (at the time,
it was named restserv). However, including eventlet as an svn external
meant that any time the externally hosted project had hosting issues,
Linden developers were not able to perform svn updates. Thus, the
eventlet source was imported into the linden source tree at the same
location, and became a fork.

Bob Ippolito has ceased working on eventlet and has stated his desire
for Linden to take its fork forward to the open source world as "the"
eventlet.
