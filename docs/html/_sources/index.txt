Welcome to Pyogp API docs
=========================

(doc set created |today|)

Pyogp is a python library for interacting with virtual world environments like Second Life. Starting as a test framework for new Open Grid Protocol work led by Linden Lab, Pyogp continues as a client library for current and future protocols.

This set of documents is primarily for use as API documentation. Pyogp is still young, and constantly evolving. Help refresh these docs regularly as work continues.
