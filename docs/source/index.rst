Welcome to the pyogp.lib.base API docs
======================================

(doc set created |today|)

Pyogp is a python library for interacting with virtual world environments like Second Life. Started as a test framework for new `Open Grid Protocol <http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Open_Grid_Protocol>`_ work led by Linden Lab, Pyogp continues as a client library for current and future protocols.

This set of documents is primarily for use as API documentation for the pyogp.lib.base package. This package contains the basic networking, messaging, datatypes, and event system modules used in establishing a client connection to a Second Life grid.

Other resources on the web:

* Project Home - `<http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/PyOGP>`_
* User Docs - `<http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/PyOGP_Client_Library>`_

Pyogp is still young, and constantly evolving. Help refresh these docs regularly as work continues.
