Viewer object cache implementation

Important to have because if we're debugging potential state management issues
in the viewer's scene graph, we need an idea of what it's scene graph _should_
look like at the current point in time. We can get that by hooking into its
VOCache so we know about its cache hits, and then compare whats in the proxy's
ObjectManager vs the viewer's (through GDB or something.)

Everything little-endian unless otherwise specified.
These use native struct alignment and padding, which is the reason for the
native address size being stored in the header. They should have just packed
the structs properly instead.

object.cache index file:
    IndexMetaHeader:
        U32 version = 15;
        U32 address_size = 32 or 64;
        CacheIndex entries[128];

    Exactly 128 region entries allowed, if any are missing they will have `time == 0`
    and should be skipped.

    CacheIndex:
        S32 index = i; // redundant, but helpful
        U64 handle; // ORed together global X and Y
        U32 time;


objects_<grid_x>_<grix_y>.slc:
    ObjectsMetaHeader:
        // must match ID sent in RegionHandshake. Filenames do not include grid ID so this may be
        // a file for a region at the same coords on a completely different grid!
        UUID cache_id;
        S32 num_entries;

    VOCacheEntry:
        U32 local_id;
        U32 crc;
        S32 hit_count;
        S32 dupe_count;
        S32 crc_change_count;
        // must be <= 10000 and > 0. Failing this continues parsing without reading data.
        S32 size;
        if (size <= 10000 && entry.size > 0)
            U8 data[size]; // same representation as "data" in ObjectUpdateCompressed
        else
            U8 data[0];


    ObjectsMetaHeader header;
    for i in range(header.num_entries) {
        VOCacheEntry entry;
    }
